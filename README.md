# Shop-Recommendation-and-Trip-planning-system
The Shop Recommendation and Trip Planning System is a smart application designed to help users find the best shops based on their preferences and plan efficient trips accordingly. It uses user location, shopping interests, budget, and time constraints to recommend nearby shops that match their needs. The system not only suggests relevant shopping options but also generates an optimized route covering all selected shops to minimize travel time and effort. It supports location-based filtering and takes into account past user behavior to improve future recommendations. The goal of this project is to enhance the shopping experience by making it more organized, time-saving, and personalized. Built using technologies like Python for the backend, a web-based frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and tools like Google Maps API for route planning, the system is both practical and user-friendly.
